# Ignore the Extremely Improbable.  

What does this have to do with utility functions? 

Does understanding how utility functions work help make sense of this principle?

Is this always a good idea?

If insurance companies always make money, should you have it?

How does this relate to utility theory?

# Higgs boson

&lt;blockquote cite="Wikipedia"&gt;To conclude that a new particle has been found, particle physicists require that the statistical analysis of two independent particle detectors each indicate that there is lesser than a one-in-a-million chance that the observed decay signatures are due to just background random Standard Model events.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

# Bias

* sampling bias 

* reporting bias

&gt; Suppose that  I want to track how many calories I consume every day for a month. In the course of that month, I become sick for a few days and can only eat ice cream. Afterwards, I argue that I should not include those days in my analysis, because I was sick and not eating right. Would my study be biased? What type of bias?
