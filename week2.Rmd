# Out of how many 

1. If I ask "How many IU undergrads drank last weekend?" what is the right number for "out of how many"?

1. What if I change the question to "How many freshman?"

1. Of course the total undergrads and the total freshman that drank last weekend will be much different. 

    a. What about the percentages? Similar? Different? 
    
    b. How much different? 
    
    c. To try to answer such a question, you need 4 numbers. What are they?

???

* Undergrads: 32794
* Freshman: 8291
* Simulate guesses for the four numbers

# Who's clumping?
    
    
.pull-left[    
* 0's and 1's tend to "clump" together when random

* The author calls this "Poisson clumping"

* Can you think of some other examples where clumping happens? 

* What about where people note it as significant of something?

# Pot odds and sunk costs

* p. 51, "[the money] belongs to the pot, not you"

* There's $1000 in the pot

* $250 of it came from your stack

* The raise is $100

* You have a 20% chance of winning if you call

* What do you do?

???

Correct:
Win = 1100 x .2 = 220
Call and lose = -$100 x .8 = -80
Fold = 0

Wrong (doesn't matter, you still call):
Win = 1100 x .2 = 220
Call and lose = -350 x .8 = -120
Fold = -250

Makes you __more__ likely to bet (you bet if Ev > -stack x prob)

What are some other sunk costs?

# Exams

This class has two exams. Suppose you get a 40 on the midterm. 

1. Argue that you'll do better on the final.

2. Suppose you get a 45 on the final. 

    Will I be receptive to an argument that your exam scores don't reflect your ability? Why or why not?
    
1. Can you think of other examples of "regression to the mean"?

# Black Monday

* Monday 30 December 2019

* Fire all the coaches!

* Jay Gruden -- Won 9, 8, 7, and 7 is his last 4 before losing the first 5 games this year

* Freddie Kitchens won 6 games in this, his only season

* Ron Rivera got fired after winning 5/12 games this year, his 9th (3 good and 6 mediocre)

* Jason Garrett went 8-8 in his 10th year

* Pat Shurmur won 5 and 4 games in his only two seasons

* 3 got the boot for being "mostly mediocre" over a long period (Gruden, Rivera, Garrett) while the other two had pretty poor records

* Does this seem fair? 

* Should the two short termers have gotten time to turn it around? 

* Would they have gotten to "mostly mediocre" too or even "pretty good"? 

* In what ways might the "law of large numbers" apply here?
